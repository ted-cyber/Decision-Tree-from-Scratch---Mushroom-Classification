# Decision-Tree-from-Scratch---Mushroom-Classification
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier from first principles using Python and NumPy. The primary goal was to classify whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on a dataset of their physical attributes. This hands-on implementation reinforces fundamental machine learning concepts such as entropy, information gain
