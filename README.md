Decision Tree from Scratch - Mushroom Classification

Description

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier from first principles using Python and NumPy. The primary goal was to classify whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on a dataset of their physical attributes. This hands-on implementation reinforces fundamental machine learning concepts such as entropy, information gain, and recursive tree building.


Features/Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the implementation.
NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation, which is crucial for handling the dataset and calculations (entropy, information gain).
Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for developing, documenting, and demonstrating the classifier's functionality.
Core Concepts:
Entropy: A measure of the impurity or disorder in a set of data.
Information Gain: The reduction in entropy achieved by splitting data on a particular feature, used to select the best splitting criterion at each node.
Recursive Tree Building: The iterative process of constructing the tree by repeatedly finding the best split and forming child nodes until a stopping condition is met (e.g., maximum depth, pure node).
Binary Classification: The task of classifying items into one of two categories (edible or poisonous).
